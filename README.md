# Data-Analysis-Ecommerce-Project

This project is a data analysis that aims to understand the performance of payment methods in the Pakistan Largest Ecommerce Dataset. The main question to be answered is, "How does the payment method perform in terms of transaction success and nominal income?" This analysis will provide valuable insights for e-commerce businesses to increase efficiency and profits.

Analysis Steps
The data analysis process will follow these steps:

Data Understanding: First, we'll look at general information about this dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, data type, as well as initial summary statistics. This will help us understand the dataset better.

Data Preparation: This process involves cleaning and preparing the data. We will identify and handle missing or invalid values, remove duplicates if any, and perform other data preparation steps.

Transaction Analysis: We will dig into transaction data to understand how many transactions were successful and how many failed. This will provide an idea of the overall success of transactions on the platform.

Payment Method Analysis: We will analyze the performance of each payment method used in the dataset. This will include how often each method is used, the total revenue generated from each method, and the average transaction size for each method.

Conclusions and Recommendations: Finally, we will draw conclusions based on the data analysis we have carried out. We will also provide recommendations to e-commerce businesses based on our findings.

Conclusion
This project will provide a better understanding of how payment methods impact transaction success and revenue in e-commerce in Pakistan. The conclusions and recommendations resulting from this data analysis will be a valuable guide for businesses in taking better steps to increase their efficiency and profits.
